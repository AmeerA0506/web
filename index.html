<h2> The Backstory </h2> 
 <p> Albert Arnold Gore Jr. is an American politician and environmentalist who served as the 45th vice president of the United States from 1993 to 2001.
 In his 2000 election bid, Al Gore ran on various climate reforms, social security reforms, and healthcare reforms. He was the incumbent Vice President 
from the previous 2 administrations. His opponent, George W. Bush, is a politician who was the governor of Texas headed towards the election. His brother,
 Jeb Bush, was the governor of Florida and his father was the 41st president. Since both challengers had very qualified history, this election was set to 
be a close one, with most projections putting Al Gore as the victor. This face-off was nothing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2012/10/01/debate-fun-gore-sigh.cnn"> sigh at.</a>
<h2> Election Day </h2>  
<p> It was the day everyone was looking forwards to. Millions of people lining up at the polls to finally see who truly deserves the seat in the Oval Office. 
It was going to be a close one. As the booths were closing, some were staying open due to the immense amounts of citizens still needed to cast their ballots.
 At around 8:30 P.M EST, Florida was called for Al Gore on CNN <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/11/08/to-prove-media-get-election-calls-wrong-trump-staffers-tweet-newspaper-headline-thats-exposed-as-fake/?sh=59291a935061"> 
(not to be confused with being President-elect) </a> The electoral college projection was 192-185 with Gore leading. However, 15 minutes later, Florida was
 unprojected only to be to close to call, dropping the projected electoral college projection to 167-185 with Bush leading. As the very close election continued, 
it could have went to either side at this point. At 2:10 AM EST, after 6 grueling hours of watching states be projected, George W Bush was declared victor after
 Florida went to him. Al Gore, as most opponents do, conceded then and there and congratulated George Bush for his win. However, the vote difference in Florida was
 narrowing. Al Gore called George Bush to un-concede the race. 
<h2> Florida's Election  </h2>  
<p>  It is unprecedented  <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump-refuses-to-concede-in-first-post-election-tv-appearance/a-55766431"> (unless a certain someone doesn't concede until January 6th)</a> that an election goes on for longer than 12 hours.
 Florida's election was now being heavily scrutinized. People were infuriated that the media prematurely called twice while also very curious as to what happened.
So what happened? It turns out that Florida's ballot system was unequivocally a mess. Their ballots were designed awfully, with some Al Gore voters accidentally voting 
for Buchanan due to the position of Gore's name. Some election problems are usual, but this is the closest election on a federal level. With the butterfly ballots
 as they called it as well as other votes that couldn't be counted because multiple names or zero names being voted for(70-80 thousand of them to be exact), 
many were waiting for a ruling from a court. It went down to the Florida Supreme Court. They ruled that Al Gore had a right to call for a recount in four specific
 counties. However, a U.S Supreme Court ruling (split on partisan lines 5-4) ruled that the recount needs to be stopped as it violated the Equal Protections act.
 With the recount stopped, there was no legal way for Al Gore to circumvent the loss, so he conceded immediately after the Supreme Court's ruling, 36 days after the
 election had started. Many analysts say that (had the four counties been recounted) Al Gore would have won the election. As Gore himself said, "Ignoring votes is 
ignoring democracy itself". I personally agree with that sentiment. Since it's a near consensus that Gore would have become president if the ballots were designed better, It is only fair to say that Al Gore was robbed.

<h2> Aftermath + Conclusion </h2>
 <p> There was obviously outrage following this election. It is baffling that someone can physically get more votes in enough states to get 270 electoral votes while
 also getting 500k total more votes, they should be the president, period. This outrage, compounded with what happened in 2016 (and whoever was in the seat from 2017 until 2021) 
fuels the fire to claims that we should abolish the electoral college. The more people who vote, the merrier and whoever gets more people to vote for them should win.
 Al Gore would have objectively been a better president too. George W. put us into a recession, bombed the Middle East because  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/07/iraq.usa">"God told [him] to end the tyranny in Iraq"</a>.
 Climate change is still an issue and going to be an issue for years to come unless both sides get their stuff together. Al Gore was far ahead in all of these reforms and would have provided for a better America. I will never stop talking about this election.
 There was so much incompetence, from the people who designed the ballots (who were Dems) all the way down to the Supreme Courts, and so many others. It is a perfect reflection of the failures of American politics as we know it. In fact, Florida 
  <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/11/20/461296/voter-suppression-2018-midterm-elections/"> still has an issue with voting. </a>
