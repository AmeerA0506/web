<h2> The Backstory </h2> 
 <p> Albert Arnold Gore Jr. is an American politician and environmentalist who served as the 45th vice president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. In his 2000 election bid, Al Gore ran on various climate reforms, social security reforms, and healthcare reforms. He was the incumbent Vice President from the previous 2 administrations. His opponent, George W. Bush, is a politician who was the governor of Texas headed towards the election. His brother, Jeb Bush, was the governor of Florida and his father was the 41st president. Since both challengers had very qualified history, this election was set to be a close one, with most projections putting Al Gore as the victor.   </p>
<h2> Election Day </h2>  
<p> It was the day everyone was looking forwards to. Millions of people lining up at the polls to finally see who truly deserves the seat in the Oval Office. It was going to be a close one. As the booths were closing, some were staying open due to the immense amounts of citizens still needed to cast their ballots. At around 8:30 P.M EST, Florida was called for Al Gore on CNN. The electoral college projection was 192-185 with Gore leading. However, 15 minutes later, Florida was projected to be to close to call, dropping the projected electoral college projection to 167-185 with Bush leading. As the very close election continued, it could have went to either side at this point. At 2:10 AM EST, after 6 grueling hours of watching states be projected, George W Bush was declared victor after Florida went to him. Al Gore, as most opponents do, conceded then and there and congratulated George Bush for his win. However, the vote difference in Florida was narrowing. Al Gore called George Bush to un-concede the race. 
<h2> Florida's Election  </h2>  
<p>  It is unprecedented (unless a certain someone doesn't concede until January 6th)  that an election goes on for longer than 12 hours. Florida's election was now being heavily scrutinized. People were infuriated that the media prematurely called twice while also very curious as to what happened.

So what happened? It turns out that Florida's ballot system was unequivocally a mess. Their ballots were designed awfully, with some Al Gore voters accidentally voting for Buchanan due to the position of Gore's name. Some election problems are usual, but this is the closest election on a federal level. With the butterfly ballots as they called it as well as other votes that couldn't be counted because multiple names or zero names being voted for(70-80 thousand of them to be exact), many were waiting for a ruling from a court. It went down to the Florida Supreme Court. They ruled that Al Gore had a right to call for a recount in four specific counties. However, a U.S Supreme Court ruling (split on partisan lines 5-4) ruled that the recount needs to be stopped as it violated the Equal Protections act. With the recount stopped, there was no legal way for Al Gore to circumvent the loss, so he conceded immediately after the Supreme Court's ruling, 36 days after the election had started. Many analysts say that (had the four counties been recounted) Al Gore would have won the election. As Gore himself said, "Ignoring votes is ignoring democracy itself". I personally agree with that sentiment. Since it's a near consensus that Gore would have become president if the ballots were designed better, It is only fair to say that Al Gore was robbed.
